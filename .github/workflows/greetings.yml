            First of all, thank you for taking the time to contribute. We're excited to see your ideas and improvements! 🎉

            Here are a few things to keep in mind as you open this pull request:

            1. 📝 Please make sure your PR title is clear and descriptive. It should briefly summarize the changes you're proposing.

            2. 🔍 In the PR description, provide more details about your changes. What problem does this solve? How did you implement the solution?

            3. ✅ Ensure that your code follows our [coding standards and style guide](link-to-your-style-guide). We use ESLint to maintain code quality, so make sure your changes pass the linter.

            4. 🧪 If you've added new functionality, please include appropriate tests. All existing tests should also pass.

            5. 📚 Update the documentation if your changes require it. This includes both inline code comments and any external docs.

            6. 🔀 Make sure your branch is up to date with the main branch before submitting the PR.

            7. 👀 Be open to feedback. Our review process is here to ensure quality and consistency. If we request changes, don't be discouraged!

            8. 🤝 Be respectful and constructive in any discussion that arises. We're all here to learn and improve the project together.
